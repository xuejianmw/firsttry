goal: a calculator for the best proportion of basic lands in MTG.

v1: a calculator for the best proportion of basic lands in 2-color limited 40-card deck.
principal: the highest probability to cast each card on the hand with right number of lands.
core algebra: find a number of color 1 x that either increase or decrease its number will cause a decrease in mean probability
outline:
1. input the mana cost of the cards
2. use the proportion to get a initial value of lands
3. use probability to find the final value of lands
4. output
